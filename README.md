# Midterm: CMPS 301 Programming Concepts - Spring 2024

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to three problems assigned as the Midterm for CMPS 301: Programming Concepts for the Spring 2024 semester. The assignment involves implementing programs related to a BMI calculator, a Birthday Date Meaning Generator, and a Basic math calculator.

### Problem 1: BMI Calculator
In this program, we implement functionality for BMI calculator, where users can find out their BMI, based on their weight and height. The intended audience people who are interested in their BMI, like gym-goers, athletes, people trying to lose weight.

This program tells the user what their birthday means, given the month, day, and year of it. The intended audience is people who don't know what their birthday means, people who like astrology, and the general public.

### Problem 3: Basic Math Calculator.
This program serves as a calculator for the user, who enters a problem they want solved. The intended audience is anyone trying to solve a relatively simple math prolem, like math class students, people calculating tip at a restaurant, accountants, children.

## Features
1. **Problem 1 (BMI Calculator)**:
   - Asks the user questions about: their name, age, gender, height by feet, height by inches, and their weight in pounds, saving each response as a variable.

   - Lets the user enter another birthday if they wish.

4. **Problem 3 (Basic Math Calculator)**:
   - Asks the user for a problem they would like to solve.
   - Uses a conditional statement to determine which operand they used, and apply it to solve the problem.
   - Presents the answer of the problem.
   - Lets the user solve another problem if they wish.
